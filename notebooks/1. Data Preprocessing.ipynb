    "## Data Acquisition\n",

    "This is the \"acquisition\" of data for the country selector project. I do not intend to publish my work in hopes for any material benefits, however, I will list here all the data resources I have used for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I would like to take you through my thought process. At first, I wanted to use a Kaggle data set upon which I could try my hands at clustering. This would have been done through the [world happiness report dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report). But I wanted to build it as a project that would be useful to many people in general. So I came up with the idea of a country selector. I have all these clusters of countries which have a lot of things in common; I check what those things are and I use them as \"group features\". These group features will then be presented to the user as a choice and then the user will see what group of countries scores the best in those areas, hence giving him an idea of what countries should he look more into.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this having been said, I have done a fast (I still wanted to keep this a small project) research in order to see what are the most important criteria when choosing another place to live. I have documented this small endeavour in [this file](research.txt). Keeping these measures in mind, I browsed the web for data about countries' healthcare system, finance, climate, laws etc. and downloaded them. Again, keeping it short, since data was not available on one site, I just downloaded it instead of learning how to use different APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used the following websites to download my data and I give them full credit for this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://climatedata.worldbank.org\n",
    "\n",
    "https://worldpopulationreview.com\n",
    "\n",
    "https://databank.worldbank.org\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will deal with transforming all the data obtained into one smooth dataset. Therefore here I will combine all these datasets into one. I will drop all the countries which have less than 70% of necessary data or (if possible) find a solution to impute missing data. The data is also not similar in terms of timeline. Therefore, if the data is available, I will select the most recent one. All the data I have downloaded is at most 4 years old (2018) at the moment of this notebook's creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also see if I can transform data values so that they are on similar scales, since it should (in theory) be better for clustering. I will apply other aggregations and replacement where I see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore there will be 4 steps, 1 for each type of data. The 5th an final step will be getting all these datasets cleaned and into one useful dataset to be used in the main part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's wrangle some data."

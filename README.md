<h1 style="text-align: center"> üåç Country Selector </h1>

## Business Case

This project aims to answer an interesting question: what countries would fit me
the most if I wanted to change states? I believe that a lot of people have the
opportunity to work remotely now and can decide to travel or even settle in a
new country. Using general data about countries, one can gain a little bit of
insight about what group of countries would suit her/his needs.

Using clustering we can split all the countries into groups and then draw
different conclusions about those groups. The aim was to find all
characteristics that differentiate these groups and use them for the little
country selector recommendation system.

## 1. File/Folder descriptions

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

* data: this is a folder containing all of the Data
    * initial_data: a folder which contains the excel file containing raw data
    * dated folders: folders created on the date of their name as a result of running the notebook; these folders contain images and text files on which to conclude an analysis of the task habits
* EDA To Do List.ipynb: the jupyter notebook containing all the logic
* Daily "to do"s - an insight.pdf: a presentation that I created for myself as an exercise to create a presentation for stakeholders on future projects
* requirements.txt: all the libraries used in the jupyter notebook

## 2. Data preparation

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

What I had to begin with was just sheets of paper, each of them dated ad containing tasks that were checked as done or not done. So I had to decide how to approach getting them into my computer.

First idea was, of course, manual labour. Then I thought: maybe I could use some form of character recognition and then use machine learning to split them into groups. But when I thought about it, I remembered that I did not build this to do list system with the intention of doing anything with it. Therefore I had no categories, just tasks. I decided that manually transcribing was my best bet, since I could see the tasks and categorize it myself. I also had to think of a system to track tasks within a day that were of the same category, some finished and some unfinished.

I used Google Sheets to make it easier for me to find categories and such and this was the results I came to:

<br>

Getting the right format of data was interesting to do because what I wanted to achieve in the end was the "success level" of the day. This was the number of tasks I have succeeded to do over the number of tasks I have planned to do. So categories that contain -x+y means that x tasks from that category did not succeed, while y did. And that there were a total of (x+y) tasks in that category that day.

Info about data preprocessing and getting to a reasonable data format to use within the code is available in the notebook.

## 3. Exploratory data analysis

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

This was the main idea of the project. What can the data tell me about the tasks that I have noted. For this to work, I had to come up with statistics I would like to see based on how I defined the data in the preprocessing step.

### 3.1 What we search for

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

This was a brainstorming step. I would think about the data structure and how I can mold it to tell me specific things.

Ideas that I believed were important and/or interesting are:
- tasks with most probability to fail
- tasks with most probability to succeed
- descriptive statistics about day success (IQR, median etc.)
- total success rate per each category
- productivity rates in time
- heatmap for numerical values
- plot success rate against number of tasks
- define categories: quick, get_out_of_house, cleaning, work, physical, reading, mentality_of_day, talk_to_people and for each plot boxplots with success rate to see which activities you are most likely to do

These are some of the things I wanted to see. All that I initially wanted to see is well documented in the notebook.

### 3.2 Extracting the statistics

Some of the statistics were relevant number-wise

while others were more interesting to visualize as graphs

## 4. Conclusion

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

There were great insights into my own organization whereabouts. This was all summarized in a
[presentation](./Daily%20‚Äúto%20do‚Äùs%20-%20an%20insight.pdf) I created for myself. As I have done in the notebook, I will list some of the things I have learnt here.

</details>

### 4.1 What did I learn?

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

Firstly and most importantly, there were tasks which I consistently wanted to do and did not succeed (most of the time) in doing them. The solution for "curing" this would be to take one of these tasks and focus (almost) daily on it. This would in turn build a habit. When I am comfortable that I can succeed in this task on a daily basis, I can go ahead and repeat this process with the task such task.

Another interesting fact is that there were relatively easy to do tasks (do not take a lot of time) that were mostly missed because of how I organized my day. This made me be more aware of my **actual** time within a day and plan accordingly.

This is an out of data scope insight, but I see that when I do make these lists, I tend to get more done. So I will continue to create them. And I will also have a weekly paper to computer session when I transcribe to do lists from previous week. This will also hold me accountable to update this project and see how my behaviour changes.

### 4.2 Future improvements

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

There are some things that I would like to have in the future.

- Have a script to run the jupyter notebook (and generate all the useful data) for data between 2 certain dates. This way I can track progress along time frames and not necessarily between start and current time.
- Come up with more statistics to see. I am sure there are insights I have missed. But if in the future I can come back to this project with a fresh perspective I am sure I can come up with more useful insights to extract.
- See if I can come up with some features for modelling and see if there's a day formula for guaranteed success.

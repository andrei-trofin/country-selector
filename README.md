<h1 style="text-align: center"> üåç Country Selector </h1>

## Business Case

This project aims to answer an interesting question: what countries would fit me
the most if I wanted to change states? I believe that a lot of people have the
opportunity to work remotely now and can decide to travel or even settle in a
new country. Using general data about countries, one can gain a little bit of
insight about what group of countries would suit her/his needs.

Using clustering we can split all the countries into groups and then draw
different conclusions about those groups. The aim was to find all
characteristics that differentiate these groups and use them for the little
country selector recommendation system.

## 2. Data preparation

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

The work here was done in the [data processing notebook.](./notebooks/1.Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb)

I have downloaded data from different sites. I based my logic on research I have done in the 
[research file](research.txt). I wanted to see what are the main factors that people look for when
moving to a different country. After I have made a list, I went on and searched for data.
Because I did not manage to find one single place in which to download all data, I did not spend additional time
to learn the API of any particular site, but rather downloaded the raw data myself.

<br>
<br>

I have put all the data in the [data folder](./data/) and went through it all and tried to make one clean dataset.
Some of the data such as precipitation, temperature, education, employment, poverty, private and public sector 
did not make it into the final set due to the lack of values for the majority of the countries.

Therefore, the [final dataset](./data/cleaned_data.csv) contains data about 117 countries. This data refers to: 
happiness, economy, crime rate, infrastructure, finance, health, population and environment. A total of 22 columns were 
extracted, making this dataset a 117 x 22 dataframe. This is the dataset used to create clusters upon which the 
application is built.
